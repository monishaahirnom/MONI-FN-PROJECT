function [a,f,B,W]=ldatrace(b,w,n,c)
%LDATRACE Calculates an LDA transform to maximize trace discriminant [a,f,B,W]=(b,w,n,c)
% If a feature vector X can come from one of several class and W and B are respectively
% the within-class and between-class covariance matrices, then the generalized Fisher discriminant
% F=trace(W\B) is a measure of how well the feature vector discriminates between the classes.
% If we choose a rectangular (tall, skinny) transformation matrix, we can define a smaller
% feature vector Y=A'*X. The aim of this routine is to choose A to maximize the Fisher
% discriminant. We assume that W is positive definite and B is positive semi-definite.
% The input argument C allows the uset to pre-specify some of the columns of A.
%
% Inputs:
%     w[m,m] = within class covariance matrix of x
%     b[m,m] = between class covariance matrix of x [default = I]
%     n is the number of columns in output matrix A [default = M]
%     c[m,r] specifies the first few columns of A to be predefined values [default = null)
%
% Outputs:
%     a[m,n] is the transformation matrix: y=a'*x
%     f[n,1] gives the incremental gain in f value for successive columns of A 
%     B(n,n) gives the between-class covariance matrix of y
%     W[n,n] gives the within-class covariance matrix of y
