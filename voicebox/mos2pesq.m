function p=mos2pesq(m)
%MOS2PESQ convert MOS speech quality scores to PESQ p=(m)
%Inputs:    m  is a matrix of MOS scores
%
%Outputs:   p  is a matrix, the same size as m, of PESQ scores
%
% The PESQ measure is defined in [2]. The mapping function, defined in [3],
% converts raw PESQ scores (which lie in the range -0.5 to 4.5) onto the
% MOS-LQO (Mean Opinion Score - Listening Quality Objective [2]) scale in the
% range 1 to 5. The MOS scale is defined in [1] as
%           5=Excellent, 4=Good, 3=Fair, 2=Poor, 1=Bad.
